@pushchain/core@6.0.17 (unreleased)

- Fixed outbound (UOA_TO_CEA) transactions reverting on-chain with Uniswap `STF`
  when the UEA held a modest amount of native PC - e.g. pETH -> Ethereum ETH.
  Destination gas is funded by swapping the UEA's PC into the gas token, and
  `capSwapEstimate` was sizing `nativeValueForGas` down to `balance - reserve`
  even when that fell below the swap's actual requirement, so the swap reverted
  with `STF` while the native pre-flight stayed silent (its check was
  self-satisfying). The estimator now keeps the full requirement when the
  affordable amount can't cover the swap floor, so the pre-flight reports the
  real PC shortfall instead of emitting a cryptic on-chain `STF`.

- Fixed SVM payload encoding in browser environments whose `Buffer` polyfill
  does not implement Node's `writeBigUInt64LE` / `writeBigInt64LE` methods.
  The encoder now writes u64/i64 fields with `DataView`, preserving the same
  little-endian wire format without crashing during Solana transaction builds.

---

@pushchain/core@6.0.16 (2026-06-05)

- Fixed SVM domain-separator chainId encoding to match the pre-EIP-712 UEA_SVM
  behavior on Donut (raw string encoding), restoring correct SVM signature
  validation.

- Fixed Route 1 deposit-sizing progress-hook ordering: the `103-03-04` event is
  now emitted after UEA resolution so it matches the funds-payload path sequence.

- Additional cascade execution test coverage and validation fixes.

---

@pushchain/core@6.0.15 (2026-06-02)

- Internal fixes to response-building logic.

---

@pushchain/core@6.0.14 (2026-06-02)

- `trackTransaction` now resolves the originating source chain correctly even when
  the tracked hash points to Push Chain, with explicit chain-support checks.

- Added `finalTxHash` to `UniversalTxResponse` — a single hash that resolves across
  all routes (R1 → Push tx, R2 → external tx, R3 → Push inbound tx).

---

@pushchain/core@6.0.13 (2026-05-26)

- Maintenance release (version bump only; no code changes).

---

@pushchain/core@6.0.12 (2026-05-26)

- Maintenance release (version bump only; no code changes).

---

@pushchain/core@6.0.11 (2026-05-25)

- Added transaction-indexing polling for SVM multihop: the SDK now retries with
  backoff (1s polling, 30s timeout) before fetching transaction details, fixing
  failures when querying immediately after confirmation.

---

@pushchain/core@6.0.10 (2026-05-23)

- Added Borsh-encoded SVM-origin inbound relay payload building for Route 3
  (CEA → Push).

- Improved SVM child-inbound detection using log index for more reliable
  transaction identification.

---

@pushchain/core@6.0.9 (2026-05-19)

- Added a decoder for the `GasPriceBelowBase` (0x05aab006) error with an
  actionable hint about gasPrice overrides.

---

@pushchain/core@6.0.8 (2026-05-19)

- Maintenance release (version bump only; no code changes).

---

@pushchain/core@6.0.7 (2026-05-19)

- Fixed corner-case bugs in cascade execution and funds-payload handling for
  cross-chain transactions.

---

@pushchain/core@6.0.6 (2026-05-18)

- Clarified progress-event message text (no functional changes).

---

@pushchain/core@6.0.5 (2026-05-18)

- Added multihop progress markers: `SEND_TX_199_03` / `SEND_TX_199_99` (Route 1
  intermediate success) and `SEND_TX_399_99` (Route 3 round-trip completion), with
  improved cascade event sequencing.

---

@pushchain/core@6.0.4 (2026-05-18)

- Fixed payload-builder detection of executable data vs. value-only transfers,
  including multicall empty-array handling.

- Fixed progress-hook wiring for funds-only execution paths.

---

@pushchain/core@6.0.3 (2026-05-16)

- Added per-call `progressHook` support: `sendTransaction(params, { progressHook })`
  is additive with the init-time hook, auto-registers on the returned response for
  wait-phase progress, and dedupes by reference to avoid double-firing.

---

@pushchain/core@6.0.2 (2026-05-16)

- Token constants now expose the missing `USDT.bsc` chain-suffix accessor,
  while keeping `USDT.bnb` as a deprecated alias for backward compatibility.

- Updated Donut testnet stable token metadata to match the current source of
  truth: external moveable token addresses are kept separate from Push Chain
  PRC20 addresses, and the WPC/stable pool address audit table now reflects the
  documented PRC20/pool pairs.

---

@pushchain/core@6.0.1 (2026-05-15)

- Pre-flight UEA balance checks now default to warning-only behavior and
  proceed when short. `sendTransaction` and `prepareTransaction` accept
  `options.enforceGasCheck: true` to restore fail-fast behavior with
  `InsufficientUEABalanceError`; pre-flight progress hooks now report
  `WARNING` vs `ERROR` with shortfall metadata.

- Token constants added the `USDC.bsc` BSC suffix accessor while retaining
  `USDC.bnb` as a deprecated compatibility alias.

- Consolidated tests, renamed transaction `target` fields to `recipient`, and
  fixed SVM test cases around the release.

---

@pushchain/core@6.0.0 (2026-05-14)

- Updated audit-driven contract and pool configuration, including BNB CEA
  address changes and refreshed pool addresses.

- Fixed cascade, SVM payload, and SVM execution flows, with additional test-case
  coverage for the audited scenarios.

- Improved PC amount formatting in transaction output and diagnostics.

---

@pushchain/core@5.1.18 (2026-05-12)

- Added `executeTransactions` progress-hook coverage and fixed cascade
  scenarios, including fresh-UEA and six-hop flows.

- Removed the `allowUnderfundedSwap` parameter and tightened native PC
  formatting.

---

@pushchain/core@5.1.17 (2026-05-07)

- Fixed the R3 EVM path tag so progress hooks emit the `303` route family
  instead of `203`.

---

@pushchain/core@5.1.16 (2026-05-07)

- Added pre-flight balance-check progress hooks.

- Fixed SVM rent checks, SVM upward ceiling behavior, cascade progress-hook
  handling, and shared PC formatting.

---

@pushchain/core@5.1.5 (2026-04-20)

- Route 1 (UOA → Push) now applies Case A/B/C USD-bucket sizing to the
  Push-chain gas cost. Case A pads deposits to the $1 floor; Case B passes
  through; Case C is informational (deposits proceed up to the origin
  gateway's contract-enforced `MAX_CAP_UNIVERSAL_TX_USD`). The SDK's previous
  $1000 ceiling has been removed. New progress hooks `SEND_TX_103_03_01/02/03`
  fire with the sizer's decision, under the new `SEND_TX_103_03` "Calculating
  Prepaid Deposit" parent and `SEND_TX_103_03_04` "Prepaid Deposit Estimated"
  terminal (which replaces the prior `SEND_TX_102_02` "Gas Estimated").

- Gas abstraction scope narrowed to R1 (fee-lock USD caps) and R3 (outbound
  msg.value sizing). R2 (UOA → CEA) and cascade outbound segments no longer
  apply Case A/B/C; R2 `msg.value` now uses a live Uniswap V3 quote + 10%
  safety buffer, and the contract refunds any excess as PC back to the UEA.
  The `SEND_TX_202_03_A/B/C` progress hooks, the Case-C bridge-swap composer,
  and the `GasExceedsCategoryCWithErc20FundsError` error class have all been
  removed.
